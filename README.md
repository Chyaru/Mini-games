## Minigames

 - Rope Hanger: you have to guess a word letter by letter, but be careful! you have a limited amount of tries before you loose!
 - Minesweeper: The classic game where you go around and try not to explode, go looking out for the mines and try to find them all.
 - Jumping Squad: Fun for the whole family, try to reach the end by jumping spaces, but you know the computer knows every move and will fight with math.
 - Tetris: Good 'ol classic tetris, using different shapes try to make the most lines to win the highscore.
 - TypeSong: Try to write the song's lyric based on what you remember.
 - **More games to come!!!**
